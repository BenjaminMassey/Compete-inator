## Usage

There should not be any special setup other than standard Cargo Rust tools.
No runtime parameters, for example.

Users can add players via the persistent window, and then create as many match windows as they desire.
Within those matches, they may add players from the main list, and then declare a winner from those added.
Players may be deleted at any time using the trashcan button, which will be noted throughout all matches.
